Website Phishing Detection Using Data Mining
Project Overview:

This project focuses on developing a Data Mining methodology to detect website phishing, a prevalent form of cyber-crime. Utilizing a range of data mining techniques, the project aims to identify phishing websites, which are often disguised as legitimate sites to steal sensitive information.

Research and Methodology:
The approach involves a comprehensive analysis of website features such as webpage ranking, validity status, activity duration, URL length, the presence of special characters, and the number of sub-domains. These features serve as predictors in our Data Mining Model, which employs classification methods like KNN, Logistic Regression, and SVM.

Key Features:

Analysis of significant website characteristics to identify phishing attempts.
Application of various data mining classification techniques.
Performance comparison among different classifiers, with a focus on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Data Source:
The model is trained on a dataset containing 95,911 records with 12 attributes, compiled from various sources including PhishStorm. The dataset is available at [Kaggle dataset link].

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Bivariate analysis to explore feature correlations and feature-to-label relationships.
Detailed statistical analysis to ensure robust model training.
Model Training and Evaluation:
The dataset is split into a training and test set, with performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve used for model evaluation.
